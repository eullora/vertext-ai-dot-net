# ASP.NET Core MVC + Google Vertex AI Integration

## Overview

This ASP.NET Core MVC application is built to integrate with Google Cloud Vertex AI and interact with a Vertex AI Agent. On the client side, it uses **vanilla JavaScript** within the MVC Core views to send user inputs. At the backend, an **API controller** is implemented which communicates with the Vertex AI Agent using the `Google.Cloud.AIPlatform.V1` SDK. The application also makes use of **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to stream the AI responses in real time back to the client, providing a smooth and interactive experience. This setup demonstrates how a traditional ASP.NET Core MVC architecture can be effectively combined with modern AI capabilities using Google Cloud services, while keeping the frontend lightweight and responsive.
